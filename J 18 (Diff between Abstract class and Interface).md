# 🆚 Interface vs. Abstract Class in Java

| Feature | **Interface** | **Abstract Class** |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Inheritance Type** | Implements (multiple allowed) | Extends (only one allowed) |
| **Method Implementation** | Only abstract methods (before Java 8), default & static methods (since Java 8) | Can have both abstract and concrete (implemented) methods |
| **Access Modifiers for Methods** | Public and abstract by default | Can be `public`, `protected`, or `private` |
| **Instance Variables** | Only `public static final` (constants) | Can have instance variables with any access modifier |
| **Constructors** | ❌ No constructors | ✅ Can have constructors |
| **Performance** | Slower (indirect method call via interface reference) | Faster (direct method call via inheritance) |
| **Usage** | Best for defining a contract (behavior) | Best for sharing code among related classes |

## 📌 How to Use?
✔ **Interfaces** → Define behavior across unrelated classes  
✔ **Abstract Classes** → Provide a base for related classes with common logic
